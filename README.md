# PointOfSale
Demo of a Point of Sale System in .NET and .NET Core for webinnar

Note: this repository is not meant to represent production quality code, it is for demo purposes and doesn't bother with security or error handling. So it's good to use to compare a asp.net 4.6 against asp.net core 1.0. (so use at your own risk)
